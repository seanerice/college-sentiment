1,2,"The education , clubs, and career oppurtunities are about the only thing great. The campus is small and social life is lacking,greek life is being very ruthlessly attacked. Athletics here are pretty good for D3. If you are looking for a great education more so then the whole college experience RPI is a great fit."
2,4,"A lot of people complain about RPI, and yes it has issues (namely the facilities, cost, and president). However, I am so incredibly glad I came to RPI! It is such a good fit for me and frankly, I am thriving. I feel very confident about my studies and future job opportunities. It is definitely not for everyone, though."
3,3,RPI is a great research school. Most of my professors have been top notch. A lot of great research projects to hop on. There is rampant discrimination against women and people of color. Political views are very conservative. I didn't realize until I took classes elsewhere just how bad the discrimination (and violence) against women really is.
4,3,Be prepared to work- get a cool degree :)
5,4,Excellent choice for a STEM degree.
6,3,Intense school. Well known for engineers and architects. Physics major is very very hard.
7,3,Probably one of the most well reknown engineering schools in the nation. You will be worked extremely hard here. Overall a pretty good experience
8,5,It is a good school
9,5,love it here
10,3,"RPI is the top engineering school in the U.S. It is hard. Every class is a challenge, every class is a culling class. You WILL earn your degree, and the world will look up to you for it. The faculty is amazing. Tofu Tim the chef is a universal constant and center. The school is old, you will notice. Study or die. You will feel like dying. But live."
11,5,"Very good courses, top-notch undergrad education. A lot of research opportunities"
12,3,"Nice school, really love this place!"
13,5,"I've had a great time and learned a lot at RPI. The administration is totalitarian, but besides that the education is great and the students are some of the smartest you'll ever meet. There are a lot of clubs and Troy is a really nice city in my opinion. Professors really care and companies go crazy for RPI grads, even if they had low gpas."
14,1,"Is RPI known for its reputation? Yes. Will you have to work for that reputation? Yes. Is it going to be hard? Yes. Does the school make questionable budget choices? I don't know, and I'm not really sure if I want to know. If you're looking for a good degree, then do consider RPI, you'll learn a lot, and you won't regret it (most nights)."
15,3,"RPI is HARD. We have a great reputation and alot of companies want our graduates. That being said RPI makes us work for that reputation. Every class is hard, and every night is a late night. Some weekends are fun, others are lame. Social scene fluctuates with exam schedules. Sometimes you can feel the stress on campus. Still a great school though."
16,5,People give the RPI campus flack because of the questionable budgeting done by the administration but I have really enjoyed my time here. Classes have been challenging but informative with some really awesome professors! Clubs really make the semester less stressful and give you tons of opportunities to meet people. (I highly recommend trying HvZ!)
17,5,"A lot of people like to complain about RPI due to the difficulty of the courses, but I really enjoy it here. The campus is nice and the people here are ... interesting."
18,5,"I was accepted to Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, and Carnegie Mellon for Engineering and after all the time I've spent at RPI already I know without a doubt I made the right choice. The rigor is tough and you will only get through each course if you genuinely know your stuff. Grades are not inflated and might even be deflated but in the end all is even."
19,1,"If you are thinking of going here it better be because this was by far the best school you got into, otherwise go somewhere else. You will have 4 miserable years with just a few bright spots of some good times. If you have other options of similar prestige go there. There is a lot of things wrong with this place and not a lot of redeeming factors"
20,4,"All around, I love it! However, internet in most freshman dorms is awful and the school is very expensive."
21,3,"This school is good, up to you to choose."
22,3,"You are here for your education and although their are plenty of clubs to join, most of them will still leave you stuck on the boring area or in the boring area of Troy."
23,4,"The internet is fantastic over breaks due to the lower number of people but during the year it tends to cut out for a little while at least once a week. The facilities are all old. If you are looking for parties, don't go here, but if you join the right clubs, you will never want for social activities. If you're a nerd/geek, you'll probably fit it"
24,4,Great school with first class facilities and a lot of fun.
25,4,This is really a great school for engineers
26,4,"Some issues with college administration, food and grade deflation, but still definitely worth it"
27,1,"Girls that are 5's think they're 8's, parties are whack with drinks that are watered down af. Better off partying at Albany or going upstate to the other state schools."
28,1,I have a respectable GPA and am involved with many clubs on campus and am disappointed with the few internship and job opportunities I have received given what I was told during the admissions process. Do not expect to have much of a social life at RPI and expect late nights. Classrooms are old and outdated and make taking exams difficult.
29,3,"RPI definitely isn't like your typical college; it's heavy on the academics and pretty sparse on the social scene. That being said, the school is really well respected by employers and you can certainly find things to do on the weekends, you just have to put yourself out there. Overall, it's a great school if you don't mind working hard."
30,2,"RPI is a good school strictly for academics, although the professors can have strong accents and be hard to understand. RPI is expensive and doesn't have a strong social scene. Students tend to be very introverted. There is almost no school pride and many students enroll after they don't get into their first choice. I have since transferred."
31,3,Challenging classes with nothing to offer in your downtime. Town is below average and food is sub-par. No reason to fail since all there is to do is study.
32,5,Opportunities are golden. Change the world
33,5,"I love the nerdy vibe at RPI, and how people of very different backgrounds and interests can explore their passions and find new opportunities here. There's a Humans vs. Zombies club, and hiking in the ADKs with Outing Club is a ton of fun. There are also tons of club sports--I tried racquetball for the first time here and love the team!"
34,4,Amazing!
35,4,"Overall, great school. Teachers are a hit or miss."
36,4,Great University that offers many opportunities
37,3,"RPI is a great school for academics, so many opportunities available, you just have to find them. They provide great resources to help especially in freshmen year with mentor programs for certain classes. Just ask around for recommendations for things like professors, dorms, textbooks, food, etc., people generally want to help you succeed."
38,5,"Amazing professors and courses. Extremely rigorous yet rewarding. RPI challenges even the best students and I am so glad I decided to come here. The Student Body (centered around the Union, Greek Life, and D1 hockey) is very connected and uniquely student-run. There are insane amounts of opportunities to get involved on campus and everyone does...."
39,2,RPI is only worth it if you're an engineering or science major. All other majors are neglected and the facilities are absolutely horrendous. You can get a better experience for much less somewhere else.
40,5,"A nerdy vibe that I like a lot, people are pretty friendly, sometimes there aren't many social activities besides partying"
41,3,"Beautiful but VERY hilly campus. High reputation and a lot to live up to. Small cla sizes. Heavy but satisfying workload. Difficult courses but the weekends make up for it. Social scene is relatively small for school size, but it is there and it is FUN. A LOT of outreach and help in every class and every major."
42,1,"The school has a good educational reputation. However, your social life and your happiness is screwed in this school. Do not put this institute as your first priorities unless you are somebody who does NOT enjoy socializing with people. The place that this school is located (Troy, NY) is one of the creepiest places in USA (Just google the city!)."
43,3,Work hard play hard
44,5,Why not change the world? Come to RPI.
45,5,RPI is cool
46,4,"RPI is a really good fit for me. I have a lot of friends and am challenged by academics, but nothing is out of the realm of being doable."
47,1,"The school is great- if you like putting your nose to the grindstone and spending most of your free time studying. There are plenty of parties, although they're less parties and more professional drinking gatherings. As the old saying goes, RIP at RPI"
48,2,"RPI is really good if you're an engineer. If you're anything else, find someplace better. Many other departments are an after thought to the engineering school and don't have any of the resources or opportunities you would find at any other school of similar prestige or cost."
49,1,"For all the money tuition takes, this school is utter garbage. Almost no building anywhere on campus has air conditioning; the school's LMS site is down constantly; a chunk of professors are terrible; and the administration is bloated and inept, to say the least. Almost every casual conversation with students is about how awful RPI is for its cost."
50,2,Great engineering school!!!
51,5,I really enjoy it here. Great and challenging learning experience. Excellent experiences and resources for any student wanting to become and entrepreneur.
52,1,"Great people and clubs. The administration is seriously messed up. They jack up tuition whenever they feel like it. Most of the professors are only temporary, so the school doesn't have to pay them as much as the few tenured professors. Classes are awful with 100+ students in most classes for the first two years. Don't go if you're not an engineer."
53,3,"Mostly nice place surrounded by a really bad neighborhood next to a downtown that was once booming and now is slummy. A car helps, but is not necessary, and parking's a bit tight anyway. Lots of opportunities if you make them. The friends you make there are absolutely with you for life (I'm 19 years out.) Make friends quick and get on hockey line!"
54,3,"You will learn a lot, but you will be worked to the ground"
55,5,"People think Troy is scary but it's really not. There's a ton of good food around off campus, social scene is really good parties are really accessible, especially if you are a girl. Courses are interesting, but some can be crazy difficult. So far I'm maintaining Dean's List and still have a boyfriend and job and social life."
56,3,"RPI has a great reputation with strong programs, but it's plagued with bureaucracy. Good luck getting paperwork done."
57,4,"Great place to learn like you have never learned before, lots of work, some hard, some easy, but ample time to do your own thing. Lots of people seem really stressed, but it seems like they came here that way. Great opportunities are abound and some of the clubs rock and many people are in greek life, but not me."
58,3,I liked it but it could've been better.
59,4,Go to RPI and it will prepare you for a wide variety of STEM careers if you are willing to put in the effort.
60,5,"Great school, challenging but rewarding"
61,3,A great school overall I love it. Here no stupid required humanities one only has to take a few of their own choosing so the school stays accredited.
62,5,I love it here. A great place if you are into math and science.
63,4,"This school is culturally diverse, and has so many opportunities if you go after them. Food could be better, but the staff is caring and really wants you to see you go as far as you can in your future career. Whether an engineering, a business major, an architect, HASS, or science, this campus is a place a lot of people would love to call home."
64,5,Typical competitive engineering school
65,3,Building a bunch of stuff they don't need
66,4,Really great if you want to succeed as an engineer.
67,3,"RPI will push you past your limits. For many classes, they basically make you struggle as hard as you can and then even out the grades at the end. But that work ethic is what gets you a job afterwards. Socially, RPI is what you make of it. Everyone can find friends to relate to, but not by sitting in your room all day."
68,5,Great school. Challenging academically. Student body is a little nerdy but its easy to find your niche.
69,4,The area around campus can be dangerous. But if you stay on campus it is safe and beautiful.
70,3,"It would be nice to focus more on teaching instead of neglecting students for research. However, the professors are all very bright, and the research programs are great if you are a graduate student."
71,5,"Coming to RPI was the best decision I've ever made. Everyone here is so nice and friendly. Even the professors are very approachable if you have a question. The classes are challenging, but that's because you're actually learning difficult stuff. There are plenty of resources to get help if you need it too. I can honestly say I love it here."
72,4,Very well-respected engineering school. The campus is beautiful. Love the upstate NY weather. Nerd culture is alive and thriving!
73,4,"Food is pretty awful to be honest, but you can get a lot out of this school. If you want to party, you can. It's not hard to find parties before the year starts, but being in Greek Life helps a lot. Classes are pretty hard and I'm still surprised that RPI is ranked so when 75% of the class of 2018 was in the top 10% of their high school class"
74,5,"It's a really nice school all around, and the education is top-notch."
75,5,"Extremely hard school. Beautiful grounds and good classes. Highly suggest this school for Comp Sci, science, engineering, or IT. If you can't handle a lot of work and hard classes though don't come here."
76,5,A very good school for studying
77,5,Go to rpi is my best decision ever. Love the school.
78,5,This is an awesome school
79,5,very well
80,5,"Difficult courses, great development of critical thinking skills. You will be challenged."
81,5,Beautiful campus located in an ok city with a great Engineering/Science program.
82,5,"A great 4 years, lots of friends, and lots of opportunities."
83,5,GO ENGINEERS
84,5,"There are a lot of ill-formed negative ideas about RPI. There is an abundance of things to do, people that are always nice and helpful, and social events, activities, clubs, and plenty of room for you to make your own sphere. GO RED."
85,5,no
86,5,"Great for undergrad research and also for internship, coop and full time opportunities. Maybe the ranking will say something else, but its a better undergrad engineering school than Cornell, CMU, Princeton."
87,5,Rensseaer is a little isolated but there is always something to do or places to go. I am so happy to have found a place where I fit in so well.
88,5,No comment
89,5,"The education is amazing, but the city of Troy is kind of dead. However, things are changing at the school and in the city. There are also 250+ student organizations, so you can stay busy."

101,5,Currently a junior in a 5 year program at RPI and I have no regrets making the decision to come here. It is A LOT of hard work (arch student speaking here) but the satisfaction you get from it is truly rewarding. I love the campus and the people I've met here. If you're not afraid to bring out your inner nerd a little then definitely consider RPI !
102,3,None.
103,5,"Yes this is a nerdy campus, but that doesn't mean there aren't things to do. There are hockey games which are always fun to go to, and there are plenty of clubs to join. The professors are ok, although you may get a few that are a little difficult to understand, and come to RPI prepared to have homework, but I would not change my attending RPI."
104,5,Definitely AMAZING for engineering majors. Professors are great and very helpful.The career service is top notch.

115,5,Excellent educational and entrepreneurial opportunities that you must pursue with your own initiative.
116,3,The dark and cold weather of Troy make winters even more difficult on top of the academics. Join clubs and Greek life if you want to enjoy your time on campus. The School is excellent and the staff is helpful. Make friends with upper classmates and work in groups to help you survive.

125,5,"RPI isn't great in every way (avoid the politics), but I thought it was a wonderful school. The people make it what it is. The Union also has one of the most vibrant student communities in the country (funded and run by students), and while not every professor is amazing, the school has a healthy share of real gems."
